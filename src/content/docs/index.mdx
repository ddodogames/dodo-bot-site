	<Card title="Open source" icon="star">
		Anyone can run the bot themselves! Dodo-Bot will always be free and so you do not need to spend money on premium bots for features you want to use.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Collaborations are welcome!" icon="approve-check">
		Even tho, this is one project maintained by one person, collaborations are allowed by everyone and anyone can contribute to the bot whether it would be new updates or by reporting bugs.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Maintained" icon="moon">
		Updates are usually published on Friday for each dev version. Updates then move to "beta" stage and then stable releases, thus ensuring that the updates are ready for public use.
