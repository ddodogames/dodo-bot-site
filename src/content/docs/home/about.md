# What is this
Dodo-Bot is a personal project that existed since late 2021. It was mainly made for entertainment and such. It was mostly made with the goal mindset of reducing the number of bots needed to do each stuff.

Dodo-Bot can be used as a template to learn aoi.js (and ForgeScript if Rebase version is used as well). If you're just a regular user then you can also just install the bot in case you don't want to learn the library the bot was based on so.
