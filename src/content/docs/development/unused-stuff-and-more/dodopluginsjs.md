## Transcript function

Sometime ago, a function named `$transcript` was added as a attempt to make ticket progress in aoi.js much easier. This turned out to be not working in current aoi.js version (unless you somehow made it work), so it was removed eventually.

## 1.0.0

1.0.0 was the first version of the package but soon went forgotten due to the outdated information of readme file which caused 1.0.1-1 to be released just to fix that.
